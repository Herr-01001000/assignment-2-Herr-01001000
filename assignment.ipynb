    "# Exercise 2 - Functions, Modules and Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deadline: November 15\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please, stick to the style-guide excerpts for the slides and the more extensive online versions. [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for docstrings. Part of the grades in this course will be determined from the readability of your code, which depends on my expectations, which in turn depend on the style conventions ...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. During this exercise you will re-implement some production functions from the lecture on a different level of abstraction. Instead of hardcoding the number of input factors, the functions will accept an arbitrary number of inputs. As a consequence, the inputs will lose their domain specific names (\"cogn\" and \"noncogn\") and get abstract names (a vector called \"factors\"). This is a preparation for later exercises, where we will need the more general implementation. It is not per se better to use a higher abstraction level. Just use the one that feels right in the context of your project and don't be afraid of long and domain-specific names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please stick to the exact file and folder structure and the exact tags we ask you to use. Otherwise you will lose points. \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture you have seen a Python implementation of the Cobb Douglas production function given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = a \\cdot x_{1}^{\\gamma_1} x_{2}^{\\gamma_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From basic microeconomics you also know the Leontief production given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = a \\cdot min\\{x_1, x_2\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function contains the Cobb Douglas and Leontief functions as special cases. Moreover, it can be generalized to an arbitrary number of inputs. This function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y =  a \\cdot \\left ( \\sum_{j=1}^J \\gamma_j x_j^{-\\rho} \\right )^{-\\frac{1}{\\rho}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leontief function obtains if $\\rho$ approaches infinity. The Cobb Douglas Function obtains if $\\rho$ approaches 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task in this exercise will be to implement the CES production function in Python."

    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone this repository to your machine, if you have not already done so.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a branch with your GitHub username and check it out (=switch to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a subfolder called `tex` and add file called `solution.tex` to it. Later you will add your written solution to this file. Add a `.gitignore` file that ignores all Latex output and folders with the name `__pycache__` to the main directory. Commit your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In later tutorials we will need production functions that accept arbitrary numbers of inputs. You will see that this flexibility is easy to implement in Python. During this part you will work in `code/part_four/production.py`\n",
    "    - Rewrite the Cobb Douglas Function from the lecture such that it accepts a list called `factors` of arbitrary length for the input factors, and a list called `weights` of the same length as parameters. The parameter a remains unchanged. The resulting function should have the following signature:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        def general_cobb_douglas(factors, weights, a):\n",
    "            # actual code\n",
    "            return output\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - Write a CES production functionthat also works for an arbitrary number of inputs. The function signature should look like this:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        def general_ces(factors, weights, a, rho):\n",
    "            # actual code\n",
    "            return output\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - You can verify that when $\\rho$ approaches zero, the output of the CES function is close to the output of the Cobb-Douglas function. However, when $\\rho$ is exactly equal to zero, the CES function is not defined. This can be very problematic if we want to estimate the parameters of a CES function. Write a function called `robust_general_ces` that is defined for $\\rho = 0$ and returns the limit of $\\rho \\rightarrow 0$ in this case. And remember: DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Verify that the functions do what they should. To do so, call the functions with input values for which you calculated the outputs by hand. Maker sure that your code produces readable output. For this you can use code like the following:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        \n",
    "        result = general_cobb_douglas(\n",
    "            factors=[1, 2, 3], \n",
    "            weights=[0.1, 0.4, 0.5]\n",
    "        )\n",
    "\n",
    "        print('general_cobb_douglas)\n",
    "        print('factors = [1, 2, 3]')\n",
    "        print('weights = [0.1, 0.4, 0.5]')\n",
    "        print('a = 2')\n",
    "        print('Expected result: 4.57')\n",
    "        print('Calculated result: ', result)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        \n",
    "5. Next we will share code across modules. For this purpose, we break up the existing file `production.py` into two separate parts.\n",
    "    - copy the contents of `code/part_four/production.py` that are related to the robust_general_ces (i.e. the function definition of robust_general_ces, the definition of all functions that are called inside robust_general_ces, the definition of its inputs and parameters and the function calls that make sure the function behaves as expected) into the module `code/part_five/production_standalone.py`.\n",
    "    - Now copy the same contents again, but this time split them into two modules: `code/part_five/production_functions.py` should contain all function definitions. `code/part_five/production_evaluations.py` contains the rest of the code.\n",
    "    - What are the advantages of splitting up the code, especially in larger projects? Your answer should be related to what you learned about namespaces in the lecture. If you want to find out which variables are defined in the namespaces of your modules or functions, you can use print statements like the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # print all local variables, excluding some built-in variables\n",
    "        print('\\n\\nLocal variables in INDICATE MODULE OR FUNCTION):')\n",
    "        item = ''\n",
    "        for item in sorted(locals()):\n",
    "            if not item.startswith('__'):\n",
    "                print(item)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # print all global variables, excluding some built-in variables\n",
    "        print('\\nGlobal variables in INDICATE MODULE OR FUNCTION:')\n",
    "        for item in sorted(globals()):\n",
    "            if not item.startswith('__'):\n",
    "                print(item)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "      Note: You cannot put those print statements into a function as this would create a new namespace.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. When you are satisfied with your solution, add a tag called `exercise_2_solution_[your_username]`  and push your branch **including the tag** to the central server. The shell command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "\n",
    "  git push --set-upstream origin [your_branch_name] --tags\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n"
